flash(): Records a message at the end of a request and access it on the next request only.

# new try block
try:
  dinner_party.attendees += f", {username}"
  db.session.commit()
  # find the host of dinner_party
  host = User.query.filter_by(id=int(dinner_party.party_host_id)).first()
  flash(f"You successfully RSVP'd to {host.username}'s dinner party on {dinner_party.date}!")
# new except block
except:
  flash("Please enter a valid Party ID to RSVP!")

Can access flashed messages in a template file and display them on the page.

{% with messages = get_flashed_messages() %}
  {% if messages %}
    {% for message in messages %}
      {{ message }}
    {% endfor %}
  {% endif %}
{% endwith %}

Look for areas where things can go wrong.
Best practice to us flash() to provide feedback to the user on what exactly happened and how they can proceed.
