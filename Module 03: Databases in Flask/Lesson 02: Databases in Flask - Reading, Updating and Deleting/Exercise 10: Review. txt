Learned:
* query all entries with query.all(), or fetch an entry based on the value of its primary key with query.get(id).
* retrieve related objects by using the attributes instantiated with db.relationship() in your model (Reader.query.get(123).reviews.all()).
* use filter and filter_by to select database entries based on some criterion (for example, Book.query.filter(Book.year = 2020).all()).
* filter database entries by analyzing the patterns in their column values (for example, emails = Reader.query.filter(Reader.email.like('%.%@%')).all()).
* add new entries to a database, or how to rollback in case the transaction had erroneous entries.
* update existing entries in the database (for example, Reader.query.get(3).email = “new_email@example.com”).
* remove database entries (for example, db.session.delete(Reader.query.get(753))).
* combine databases with your web application’s templates (views).
