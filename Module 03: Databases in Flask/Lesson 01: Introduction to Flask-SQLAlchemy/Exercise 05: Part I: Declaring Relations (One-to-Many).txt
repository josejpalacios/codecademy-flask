In SQLAlchemy we can declare a relationship with a field initialized with the .relationship() method.
In one-to-many relationships, the relationship field is used on the ‘one’ side of the relationship. 

We declare a one-to-many relationship between Book and Review by creating the following field in the Book model:

reviews = db.relationship('Review', backref='book', lazy='dynamic')

where:
* the first argument denotes which model is to be on the ‘many’ side of the relationship: Review.
* backref = 'book' establishes a book attribute in the related class (in our case, class Review)
            which will serve to refer back to the related Book object. 
* lazy = dynamic makes related objects load as SQLAlchemy’s query objects.
