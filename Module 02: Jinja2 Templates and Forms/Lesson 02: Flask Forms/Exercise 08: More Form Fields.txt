TextAreaField: A text field that supports multi-line input.

#### Form class declaration
my_text_area = TextAreaField("Text Area Label")

BooleanField: A checkbox element is created using the BooleanField object.

#### Form class declaration
my_checkbox = BooleanField("Checkbox Label")

RadioField: A radio button group is created using the RadioField object. 

#### Form class declaration
my_radio_group = RadioField("Radio Group Label", choices=[("id1", "One"), ("id2","Two"), ("id3","Three")])

Since there are multiple buttons in this group, the instance declaration takes an argument for the
group label and a keyword argument choices which takes a list of tuples.

Each tuple represents a button in the group and contains the button identifier string and the button label string.
