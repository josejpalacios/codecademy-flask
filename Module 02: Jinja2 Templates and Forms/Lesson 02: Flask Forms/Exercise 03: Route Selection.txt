Flask addresses the challenge of expanding file structures with url_for().
The function url_for() takes a routeâ€™s function name as an argument and returns the associated URL path.

To pass variables from the template to the app, keyword arguments can be added to url_for().
They will be sent as arguments attached to the URL.

<a href="{{ url_for('my_page', id=1) }}">One</a>

It can be accessed the same way as if it was added onto the path manually.
