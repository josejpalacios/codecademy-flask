Validation: Form fields must contain data or a certain format of data in order to move forward with submission.

Enable validation in form class using the validators parameter in the form field definitions.

Validators come from the wtform.validators module.

DataRequired() Example:
from wtforms.validators import DataRequired

my_textfield = StringField("TextLabel", validators=[DataRequired()])

The validators argument takes a list of validator instances.
The DataRequired() validator simply requires a field to have something in it before the form is submitted.
Notifying the user that data is required is handled automatically.

The FlaskForm class also provides a method called validate_on_submit(),
which we can used in our route to check for a valid form submission.

if my_form.validate_on_submit():
    # get form data

The validate_on_submit() function returns True when there is a POST request and all the associated form validators are satisfied.
