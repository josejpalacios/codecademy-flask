Creating a form in the template is done by accessing attributes of the form passed to the template.

class MyForm(FlaskForm):
    my_textfield = StringField("TextLabel")
    my_submit = SubmitField("SubmitName")

Moving to a template, creating a form we simply use the form class attributes as expressions.

<form action="/" method="post">
    {{ template_form.hidden_tag() }}
    {{ template_form.my_textfield.label }}
    {{ template_form.my_textfield() }}
    {{ template_form.my_submit() }}
</form>

The first line {{ template_form.hidden_tag() }} is the other end of the CSRF protection.
While not visible in the form, this field handles the necessary tasks to protect from CSRF.

The next two lines are for the text box.
The first accesses the label of the field, which we specified as an argument when we created the field.
The second my_textfield line is the input field itself.

The last line of the form is the submit button.
Just like the HTML version, this will initiate sending the form data back to the server.
