redirect(): Move from one route to another.

redirect("url_string")

Using this function inside another route will simply send us to the URL we specify.

Can utilize url_for() within redirect().
This allows to navigate routes by specifying the route function name instead of the URL path.

redirect(url_for("new_route", _external=True, _scheme='https'))

Must add two new keyword arguments to our call of url_for():
_external=True and _scheme='https' ensure that the URL we redirect to is a secure HTTPS address and not an insecure HTTP address

Regular keyword arguments can be added if necessary.
