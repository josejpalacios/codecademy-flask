Flask provides an alternative to web forms by creating a form class in the application,
implementing the fields in the template and handling the data back in the application.

A Flask form class inherits from the class FlaskForm and includes attributes for every field.

Example:
class MyForm(FlaskForm):
    my_textfield = StringField("TextLabel")
    my_submit = SubmitField("SubmitName")
    
FlaskForm is a part of FlaskWTF.
FlaskForm is imported from the flask_wtf module and both form fields import from wtforms.

app.config["SECRET_KEY"] = "my_secret"
This is a way to protect against CSRF or Cross-Site Request Forgery. 
CSRF is an attack that used to gain control of a web application.

In order to use this form in our template, we must create an instance of it and pass it to the template using render_template().
