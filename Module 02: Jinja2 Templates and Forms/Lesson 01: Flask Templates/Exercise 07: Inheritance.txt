Template files are used to share content across multiple templates.

The file can include the top portion of the templates through the <body> tag and then the closing </body> and </html> tags.

Jinja2 statement delimiters are then used to identify the area of the template where specific content will be substituted in.

=========
base.html
=========
<html>
  <head>
    <title>MY WEBSITE</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  {% block content %}{% endblock %}
  </body>
</html>

To inherit this content in another template use the extends statement.

The code to be substituted should then be surrounded by {%block content%} and {%endblock%}.

==========
index.html
==========
{% extends "base.html"  %}
 
{% block content %}
    <p>This is my paragraph for this page.</p>
{% endblock %}
