To access the variables in our templates we need to use the expression delimiter: {{ }}.

{{ template_variable }} 

The delimiter can be used inline with text and alongside HTML elements.

Certain operations can be performed inside expression delimiters {{ }}. 

List and dictionary elements can be accessed individually inside the expression delimiters {{ }}.
