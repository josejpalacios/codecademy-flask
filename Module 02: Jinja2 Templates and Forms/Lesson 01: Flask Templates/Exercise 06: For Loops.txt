Creating lists, tables or a group of images are all repetitive tasks that can be solved using for loops.

Using the same statement delimiter block as if statements {% %}, for loops step through a range of numbers, lists and dictionaries.

Uses for for loops
* Iterate through a list variable:
{% for element in template_list %}

* Iterate through a string:
{% for char_in_string in “Hello!” %}

* Iterate through the keys of a dictionary variable:
{% for key in template_dict %}

* Iterate through keys AND values of a dictionary with items():
{% for key, value in template_dict.items() %}

Using the filter dictsort in a loop outputs the key/value pairs just like items()
