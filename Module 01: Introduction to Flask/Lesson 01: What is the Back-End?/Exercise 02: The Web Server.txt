A web server is a process running on a computer that listens for incoming requests for information over the internet and sends back responses.
Each time a user navigates to a website on their browser, the browser makes a request to the web server of that website.
Every website has at least one web server.

The specific format of a request (and the resulting response) is called the protocol.

For the simplest websites, a client makes a single request.
The web server receives that request and sends the client a response containing everything needed to view the website.
This is called a static website.
