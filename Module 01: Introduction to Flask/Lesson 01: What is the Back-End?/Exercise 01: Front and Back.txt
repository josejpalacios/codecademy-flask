The front-end is the parts of a webpage that a visitor can interact with and see.
Composed of:
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML
- Other static assets, such as images or videos. 

A client in web development may refer to the web browser.
In other circumstances, a client might be another application, a mobile device, or even a “smart” appliance!

The back-end consists of all the behind-the-scenes processes and data that make a website function and send resources to clients.
